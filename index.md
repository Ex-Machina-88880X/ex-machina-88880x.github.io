# About Us
We are Team **88880X**, otherwise known as Ex Machina.

We are all sophomores at Rock Ridge High School in Ashburn, Virginia. This is our fourth year of competing in the Vex Robotics Competition (VRC). We are all studious, ambitious individuals who are willing to work diligently for VRC, whether working asynchronously at home on code, or sacrificing entire weekends to improve and tune our robot. Not only do we strive to be among the top 10 teams in our state, we also know that VRC is a great opportunity to learn all types of engineering and programming concepts while weâ€™re at it!
 
Our engineering notebook showcases our talent of strategizing and brainstorming, designing and building, coding and testing, and actually competing with the robot as it has led us to winning the **Excellence Award** and the **Design Award** during this _Spin Up_ season.
 
On our team, everyone pitches in, and we all have different tasks and roles that help our team function as a whole.
 
The team members have the following roles:
* Amulya: Strategist / Builder / Designer
* Aneesha: Builder / Scout / Designer
* Niesha: Programmer / Designer / Driver
* Rayna: Programmer / Scout / Driver
